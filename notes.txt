Forall-Forall BD Security
-------------------------

Theoretical novelty: the unwinding technique is quite different from the ForallExists variant. 


Possible applications:
*** Unlike observational determinism and related concepts, this tracks the secret along traces, so can cope, e.g., with secrets that are added to a program through I/O facilities 
*** The key to "fixing" some problems with TPOD is to relate a trace with its counterpart leak-wise in terms of the protected secret (this may not need sequences of secrets though)
